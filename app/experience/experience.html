  <h3>Software Developer – “Do-It Programming Solutions”</h3>
  <span>(January 2018 – Present)</span>
  <p>
    Now I'm participating in the development of the application created for easy collaboration between employees. It is
    an aggregator of user accounts such as Slack, Dropbox, Google Drive, Trello, Evernote, etc.
    The main features of the application are the ability to exchange messages, files, create and edit work boards,
    provide access to them to other users.
    On this project I received a lot of knowledge about the security of user accounts and confidentiality of user data.

    In my free time, for self-study and as a hobby I develop a client part for the application that provides
    functionality for viewing statistics from gps trackers. For example drawing tracks on the map, switching between
    maps, viewing the speed limit, sorting tracks by date, import/export data, and other features which will be
    implemented in the future.
